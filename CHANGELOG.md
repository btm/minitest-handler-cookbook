### 1.1.0 (NOT RELEASED)

* [#47](https://github.com/btm/minitest-handler-cookbook/issues/47) -
  Control the version of minitest-chef-handler gem via node attribute
* [#45](https://github.com/btm/minitest-handler-cookbook/issues/45) -
  Switch test-kitchen from lxc driver to vagrant driver, allowing tests
  to be run on Windows based host (Windows VMs still not supported)

### 1.0.0

* Check both paths in files
* Wrap the new to guard against chef solo per bryanwb's suggestion
* Force a download of testing files from chef server
* Fix test/support files detection when `cookbook_path` is an Array

### v0.2.0

The path for placing your tests is now files/default/test/ however
this change is backwards compatible, the minitest-hander::default
recipe will also look in the old location
files/default/tests/minitest/

You should name your support files something that matches
files/default/test/*helper*.rb. The old support support/ location will
also be honored.

New Features:
* You can place minitest-handler anywhere in your run_list and it will
work. I like to use `include_recipe` to add it.
* You can easily limit which tests are run by setting the array
node.set[:minitest][:recipes]  with only those recipes that you want
tested
* minitest-handler now also will run test for any recipes added to the
run_list via include_recipe, environment, or roles.

Niceties:
* Added tests w/ test-kitchen 1.0, kitchen-lxc, and BATS
* huge code cleanup
