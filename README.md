stable minitest-handler cookbook: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/minitest-handler  
minitest-handler cookbook development: https://github.com/btm/minitest-handler-cookbook  

Attributes
==========

* node[:minitest][:path] - Location to store and find tests, defaults to `/var/chef/minitest`
* node[:minitest][:tests] - Test files to run, defaults to `**/*_test.rb`

Usage

Examples
========

### Tradition minitest

    class TestApache2 < MiniTest::Chef::TestCase
      def test_that_the_package_installed
        case node[:platform]
        when "ubuntu","debian"
          assert system('apt-cache policy apache2 | grep Installed | grep -v none')
        end
      end
    
      def test_that_the_service_is_running
        assert system('/etc/init.d/apache2 status')
      end
    
      def test_that_the_service_is_enabled
        assert File.exists?(Dir.glob("/etc/rc5.d/S*apache2").first)
      end
    end


### Using minitest/spec

    require 'minitest/spec'

    describe_recipe 'ark::test' do

      # It's often convenient to load these includes in a separate
      # helper along with
      # your own helper methods, but here we just include them directly:
      include MiniTest::Chef::Assertions
      include MiniTest::Chef::Context
      include MiniTest::Chef::Resources

      it "installed the unzip package" do
        package("unzip").must_be_installed
      end

      it "dumps the correct files into place with correct owner and group" do
        file("/usr/local/foo_dump/foo1.txt").must_have(:owner, "foobarbaz").and(:group, "foobarbaz")
      end

     end
